GPT PARTITIONS

This screen displays the GPT partitions for the storage device that you selected in the previous screen.  The partitions are listed in layout order.

PROCEDURE

To exit this help screen, press F3.  Then, in the installer screen, use the arrow keys to highlight either "Use the whole disk" or "Use a partition on the disk."

    * If you select "Use the whole disk," the installer records that choice and proceeds to the next task.

    * If you select "Use a partition on the disk," the next screen enables you to select which partition to use for hte installation and to make changes to the partition layout.

    CAUTION: The "Use the whole disk" selection erases the entire disk during installation.  The disk is overwritten with the Oracle Solaris OS.

    NOTE:  If the OBP does not support booting from GPT Partitions on SPARC, the "Use a partition on the disk" option will not be available for selection.  If the user wishes to manually lay out the disk, they must exit the installer and run:

    /usr/sbin/format -L vtoc -d <c#t#d#>

    to apply a VTOC label to the disk.  Once the disk has a VTOC label, manual layout can proceed as normal.

Press F2 to continue to the next screen.

NAVIGATION

Use the function keys listed at the bottom of each screen to navigate between screens. Use the arrow keys to move through the text on each screen.

Note: If your keyboard does not have function keys, or the keys do not respond, press ESC to view the alternate ESC keys for navigation.
