# Description:
#       This script contains interfaces that allow look for a service,
#	register a new service and remove a running service.
#	The service typeis assumed to be _OSInstall_.tcp and the
#	service domain is assumed to be local.
#	Lookup interface searches for the specified service name.
#	Register starts the service and checks the output to make sure that
#	the service is running before returning
#	Remove service first lookup for the service before terminating
