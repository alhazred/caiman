SELECT DOS PARTITION


This screen enables the user to make adjustments to an existing DOS partition layout, such as deleting existing partitions or creating and sizing a Solaris partition.

The screen displays the existing DOS partitions. The primary partitions are displayed in layout order. The current size and maximum available size for each partition are displayed. Up to four DOS primary partitions are displayed. If a DOS extended partition exists, its logical partitions are also displayed in the disk layout order within the extended partition.

HOW TO MODIFY SCREEN CONTENT

You can use any of the following options to modify screen content:

* Use the arrow keys to navigate to the partition you want to modify.   

* F5_Change Type - With a partition highlighted, change the partition type by pressing F5 repeatedly to cycle through the partition types until the desired partition type or Unused is displayed. If Unused is selected, the partition is destroyed, and its space is made available when resizing adjacent partitions.

* Size Fields - If the size field is highlighted, you can type changes in that field.

* F7_Reset - Press F7 to restore all data in this screen to the original settings. The changes you specify will be implemented during the installation. You can cancel your modifications by selecting F7 to reset, or by selecting F3 to return to the prior screen and redo your selections.

GUIDELINES

* Only one Solaris partition is allowed, and that Solaris partition must be used for the installation. The Solaris partition can be a primary partition or a logical partition within an extended partition. 

* A DOS partition cannot be larger than 2 TB, in order to be used for installing the operating system. For disks larger than 2 TB, use GPT partitioning.

* You can use the existing Solaris partition with the current size as the installation target. If you use an existing Solaris partition as the installation target, and you do not change the other partitions, the Solaris partition is overwritten during the installation and the other existing partitions are not changed.

* If there is an existing Solaris partition, and you want to install to a different partition, you must first delete the existing Solaris partition by changing its type to Unused in the dropdown menu. Then, you can select another partition and change its type to Solaris in the dropdown menu. 

* If you want to create a new Solaris partition within a DOS extended partition, the procedure is similar to the procedure described in the prior bullet. First, delete the existing Solaris partition, if one exists, by changing its type to Unused in the dropdown menu. Then, create a new extended partition, if one does not exist, by changing the partition type to Extended in the dropdown menu. You can resize the extended partition. Then, change one of the logical partitions in the extended partition to a Solaris partition. You can enlarge the logical partition up to the size of the containing extended partition. 

* If there is no existing Solaris partition, you must select a partition and change its type to Solaris by changing the dropdown menu selection for that partition to Solaris. During installation, this modification erases the existing partition contents. 

* If there is available space, you can resize the Solaris partition by typing a new size, up to the displayed available space, for that partition. The available space contains any contiguous unused space before or after the selected partition. If you enlarge a partition, unused space after the partition is used first. Then, unused space before the partition is used, changing the starting sector of the selected partition.

	CAUTION: If you modify a partition size or change its type, the existing partition contents will be erased during installation. Otherwise, existing partition contents are preserved during installation. If your planned changes will destroy a partition during installation, that partition is marked with a red asterisk on this screen. 

* Optional: In addition to setting up a Solaris partition to be used as the installation target, you can specify further modifications to the overall partition layout in this screen as described in "Additional Partitioning Instructions" below.	


ADDITIONAL PARTITIONING INSTRUCTIONS

In addition to selecting and setting up a Solaris partition as the installation target, you can specify any of the following modifications to the partition setup: 

* You can delete any partition by changing its partition type dropdown selection to Unused. During installation, the existing partition contents are erased, and the resultant unused space is made available to adjacent partitions.

* You can change the type of any existing partition. During installation, the existing contents will be deleted.

* You can create a new partition by selecting an Unused partition and changing the type from Unused to another type. 

* You can create one new DOS extended partition, if one does not exist, without making that partition the Solaris installation target.  Just change the existing partition type to Extended in the dropdown menu. Only one extended partition is allowed. You can resize the extended partition. 

* If there is available space, you can resize a DOS extended partition by typing a new size, up to the displayed available space, for that partition. See caution above about resizing a partition. 



NAVIGATION
