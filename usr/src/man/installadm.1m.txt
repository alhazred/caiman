DESCRIPTION

     The automated installer (AI) is used to automate the 
     installation of the OpenSolaris OS on one or more 
     SPARC and x86 systems over a network. The 
     installations can differ in architecture, packages 
     installed, disk capacity, and other parameters. 

     The minimal configuration necessary to use the 
     automated installer is to have one system as the 
     server and one client on which to install. On the 
     server, you set up an installation service, which 
     is associated with manifests, or specifications, 
     for specific x86 installations or SPARC installations.

     Manifests can include information such as a target 
     device, additional packages, partition information, 
     and other parameters. When the client boots, this 
     boot initiates a search for a manifest that matches 
     the client's machine specifications. When a matching 
     manifest is found, the client is installed with the 
     OpenSolaris release according to the specifications 
     in the manifest files.

     Use the installadm create-service command to set up 
     an install server and create an install service. 
     
     An install service is a network entity that specifies 
     the parameters for a particular type of installation. 
     These specifications are defined in XML manifest 
     files. 
     
     The automated installer uses AI ISO images to create 
     the install services. An AI ISO image is a collection 
     of software in a single file. This image is unpacked 
     when an install service is created and used to create 
     a net image that enables client installations.

     Once an install server and an installation service are 
     set up, you can install the OpenSolaris release to a 
     client on the network, per the default specifications 
     in the install service, by booting the client system.

     If you want to perform various types of installations 
     in a network, you can create and manage additional 
     install services tailored for each type of 
     installation by using the installadm create-service 
     command. For example, you can set up an install 
     service that installs the OpenSolaris OS to x86 
     clients and a service that installs the OpenSolaris OS 
     to SPARC clients.

     If you have clients with varying machine 
     specifications, you can manually create or modify 
     manifests so that the manifests cover those specific 
     machine specifications. Then, you can use the 
     installadm add command to add your new manifests to an 
     install service.

     If you want a specific client to use a specific 
     install service, you can associate a service to a 
     client by using the installadm create-client command.

     The installadm utility can be used to accomplish the 
     following tasks:
     - Set up install services
     - Set up installation images
     - Set up or remove clients
     - Add or delete manifests
     - Enable or disable install services
     - List install services
     - List manifests for an install service

     
SUBCOMMANDS AND OPTIONS
     The installadm command has the subcommands and options 
     listed below. Also, see EXAMPLES below.

    
     installadm

          Displays command usage.


    
     installadm create-service [-b <property>=<value>,...]
     [-f <bootfile>] [-n <svcname>] [-i <dhcp_ip_start> 
     -c <count_of_ipaddr>] [-s <srcimage>] <targetdir>

          Creates an install service. 
    
          The command provides the following functionality:    
          - Takes an AI ISO image (<srcimage>), unpacks it, 
            and sets up a net image in a target directory
            (<targetdir>. The net image enables client 
            installations.
          - Creates an install service and makes it 
            available on the network.
   
          Note the following specifications:
          - For SPARC install services, the first install 
            service created on an install server is the 
            service that will be used for all client 
            installations that use the install server. If 
            you want a client to use a different 
            install service from this install server, you 
            must use the installadm create-client command 
            to create a client-specific configuration. 
          - By default, both a net image and an install  
            service are created. 
          - If an existing install service name is provided, 
            that existing service is used.
          - If the -s option is not used, and the 
            <targetdir> contains a valid net image, then a 
            new install service is created with the 
            existing net image.
          - If the -i option and the -c option are used, 
            and a DHCP server is not yet configured, a DHCP 
            server is configured. 
          - If an already-configured DHCP server exists, 
            that DHCP server is updated.
          - If DHCP is running on a remote system, updates 
            can happen through secure shell. User must 
            provide authentication.

     -b   <property>=<value>,...
          For x86 clients only, sets a property value
          in the service-specific menu.lst file in /tftpboot.
          Use this option to set boot properties that are
          specific to this service. This option can accept
          multiple property=value pairs.

     -f   <bootfile>  
          Uses this boot file for the install service. If 
          boot file doesn't exist, it is created. If this 
          option is not specified, a boot file is created 
          with a default name.

     -n   <svcname>
          Uses this install service name instead of default 
          service name. 

     -i   <dhcp_ip_start>
          Sets up a new DHCP server. The IP addresses, 
          starting from dhcp_address_start, are set up.

     -c   <count_of_ipaddr>
          Sets up a total number of IP addresses in the 
          DHCP table equal to the value of the 
          count_of_ipaddr. The first IP address is the 
          value of dhcp_ip_start that is provided by the 
          -i option.  

     -s   <srcimage>
          Specifies location of AI ISO image to use for 
          setting up the install service.

     <targetdir>   
            
           Required: Specifies location to set up net image.


    
     installadm delete-service [-x] <svcname>

           Deletes an install service. Accomplishes the 
           following:
           - Removes install service from the network.
           - Stops the web server that is running for this 
             install service. 
           - Removes the manifest files and web server 
             configuration for this install service.   
         
     -x    Deletes the install service and also removes the 
           associated target net image.  

     <svcname>
     
           Required: Specifies the install service name.


    
     installadm list [-n <svcname>] [-c] [-m]

         Lists all enabled install services on a server.

         -c
             Lists the clients of the install services on a local
             server.

         -m
             Lists the manifests associated with the install ser-
             vices on a local server.

         -n <svcname>
             Lists information about the specific install service
             on  a  local server.  Or, if the -c option is speci-
             fied, lists the client information  associated  with
             the specified install service.  Or, if the -m option
             is specified, lists the  manifests  associated  with
             the specified install service.
    


     installadm enable <svcname>

          Enables a specified install service. Also,
          enables the web server associated with the
          service.

     <svcname>

           Required: Specifies the name of the install
           service to be enabled.



     installadm disable <svcname>

          Disables a specified install service. Also, 
          disables the web server associated with the 
          service.

     <svcname>
     
          Required: Specifies the name of the install 
          service to be disabled.


    
     installadm add -m <manifest> -n <svcname>

          Associates manifests with a specific install 
          service, thus making the manifests available on 
          the network, independently from creating a 
          service.

     -m   <manifest> 
          Required: Specifies the path name to a criteria 
          manifest.

     -n   <svcname>
          Required: Specifies the name of the install 
          service this manifest is to be associated with.

          Note: If the -n option is not used, a unique name 
          for the install service is automatically assigned
          using the format, 
          "_install_service_<port_number>". 

          For example, if the port number that installadm 
          selected for an install service is 46510, and 
          the -n option was not used to provide a custom 
          name for the install service, then the install 
          service name will be "_install_service_46510." 

    
     installadm remove -m <manifest> -n <svcname>

          Remove a manifest that was published with a 
          specific install service.

     -m   <manifest>

          as output by installadm list with -n option.

     -n   <svcname>
          Required: Specifies the name of the install 
          service this manifest is associated with.

    

     installadm create-client [-b <property>=<value>,...] 
     [-t <imagepath>] -e <macaddr> -n <svcname> 

          Accomplishes optional setup tasks for a specified 
          client, in order to provide custom client 
          settings that vary from the default settings used 
          by the installadm create-service command. Enables 
          user to specify a non-default service name and 
          image path for a client:
          - Specifies installation service for that client.
          - Sets up DHCP macro, if it doesn't exist.
    
     -b   <property>=<value>,...
          For x86 clients only, sets a property value 
          in the client-specific menu.lst file in /tftpboot.  
          Use this option to set boot properties that are 
          specific to this client. This option can accept
          multiple property=value pairs.

     -e   <macaddr>
          Required: Specifies a MAC address for the client.
    
     -n   <svcname>
          Required: Specifies the install service for client

          automated installer.

    

     installadm delete-client <macaddr>

          Deletes an existing client's specific service  
          information that was previously set up using the 
          installadm create-client command.

     <macaddr>
     
          Required: Specifies a MAC address for the client.



     installadm help [<subcommand>]

          Displays the syntax for the installadm utility.

     <subcommand>
     
          If subcommand is provided, the command provides
          the syntax for that subcommand.




EXAMPLES


     Example 1: Set up an install server and an install 
     service for the first time. The command includes a 
     starting IP address and total count of IP addresses, 
     in order to configure the DHCP server.

     Example% # installadm create-service -n 0906x86 \ 
     -i 10.6.68.201 -c 5 -s \
     /export/aiimages/osol-0906-ai-x86.iso \
     /export/aiserver/osol-0906-ai-x86


     In this example, the terminal displays the progress 
     as follows:

     Setting up the target image at 
     /export/aiserver/osol-0906-ai-x86 ...
     Registering the service 0906x86._OSInstall._tcp.local
     Creating DHCP Server
     Created DHCP configuration file.
     Created dhcptab.
     Added "Locale" macro to dhcptab.
     Added server macro to dhcptab - line1-x4100.
     DHCP server started.
     Added network macro to dhcptab - 10.0.0.0.
     Created network table.
     copying boot file to 
     /tftpboot/pxegrub.I86PC.OpenSolaris-1
     Service discovery fallback mechanism set up

     The AI ISO image is at 
     /export/aiimages/osol-0906-ai-x86.iso. The command 
     sets up a net image and an install service that is 
     based on the AI ISO image.

     The installation net image is created in the 
     /export/aiserver/osol-0906-ai-x86 target directory. 
     This net image enables client installations.

     The progress display shows that the install service, 
     named 0906x86, is created. 

     A boot file is created, also named 0906x86, 
     under /tftpboot. The client will get this file name 
     through DHCP. The command also creates a link from 
     the net image at /export/aiserver/osol-0906-ai-x86 
     to a web server that is running on port 5555.
    
     The DHCP server and macro is created. The starting 
     IP address is 0.6.68.201. Five IP addresses are 
     allocated for clients. The command results 
     identify the macro as dhcp_macro_0906x86.



     Example 2: Use the following sample command to set 
     up a client that references a specific install service 
     and a specific net image location.

     The install service and net image should already exist. 

     # installadm create-client -b "console=ttya" \
     -e 0:e0:81:5d:bf:e0 -t \
     /export/aiserver/osol-0906-ai-x86 -n 0906x86

     In this example, the terminal displays the 
     following output:

     ---
     Setting up X86 client...
     Service discovery fallback mechanism set up

     Detected that DHCP is not set up on this server.
     If not already configured, please create a DHCP macro
     named 0100E0815DBFE0 with:
     Boot server IP (BootSrvA) : 10.6.68.29
     Boot file      (BootFile) : 0100E0815DBFE0
     If you are running the Solaris DHCP Server, use the 
     following command to add the DHCP macro, 
     0100E0815DBFE0:
     /usr/sbin/dhtadm -g -A -m 0100E0815DBFE0 -d \    
     :BootSrvA=10.6.68.29:BootFile=0100E0815DBFE0:\
     GrubMenu=menu.lst.0100E0815DBFE0:

     Note: Be sure to assign client IP address(es) if needed
     (e.g., if running the Solaris DHCP Server, run pntadm(1M)).
     ----

     In this example, the command creates a 
     client-specific setup for the system with MAC address 
     of 0:e0:81:5d:bf:e0. 
     
     This client will use the install service previously 
     set up, named 0906x86, and the net image at 
     /export/aiserver/osol-0906-ai-x86.

     Using the -b option, the command sets the console 
     value, <console=ttya>, in the client-specific 
     menu.lst file in /tftpboot.
 
     As shown above, this command outputs the name of 
     the client-specific macro, 0100E0815DBFE0,
     and its values that need to be added to the DHCP 
     server. If you have a Sun DHCP server, create the 
     above macro on your DHCP server by running the dhtadm 
     command from the output on your DHCP server.

     The pntadm(1M) command may need to be called if you 
     set up a Sun DHCP server and client IP addresses 
     need to be assigned.  See the pntadm(1M) manpage for 
     more information.

     On systems which support graphic interfaces, the 
     DHCP Manager may be used instead of the dhtadm or 
     pntadm commands. See the dhcpmgr(1M) manpage for more 
     information.

     
     Example 3: Use the following sample command
     to add a new custom manifest to an existing install 
     service: 
 
     # installadm add -m criteria_mac.xml \
     -n service_032509

     The command assigns the manifest, criteria_mac.xml
     to the install service, service_032509.
   
     For further information about creating and using new 
     manifests, see http://dlc.sun.com/osol/docs/content
     /dev/AIinstall/.


     Example 4: Use the following  sample  command  to  list  the
     install services on a local server:

         # installadm list

     In this example, the terminal displays the following output:

.sp
.in +9
.nf
Service Name Status       Arch  Port  Image Path
------------ ------       ----  ----  ----------
svc-2008-11  off          x86   45602 /export/server/osol-0811-ai-x86
svc-2009-06  on           x86   45601 /export/server/osol-0906-ai-x86
svc-bld-127  on           x86   45603 /export/server/osol-b127-ai-x86
.fi
.in -9
.sp

     Example 5: Use the following  sample  command  to  list  the
     clients for a specific install service of a local server:

         # installadm list -c -n svc-2009-06

     In this example, the terminal displays the following output:

.sp
.in +9
.nf
Service Name Client Address    Arch  Image Path
------------ --------------    ----  ----------
svc-2009-06  01:C2:52:E6:4B:E1 x86   /export/server/osol-0906-ai-x86
.fi
.in -9
.sp

     Example 6: Use the following sample command to list the man-
     ifests associated with a specific install service on a local
     server:

         # installadm list -m -n svc-2009-06

     In this example, the terminal displays the following output:

.sp
.in +9
.nf
Manifest          Criteria
--------          --------
