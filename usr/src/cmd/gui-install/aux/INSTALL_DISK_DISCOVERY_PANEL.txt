Disk Discovery

This panel enables you to select what kind of disks should
be found and presented for selection as the target for the
installation.

Select one of following types of disks:

- Local disks	  
  Disks that are attached to the computer, including internal 
  and external hard disks.

- iSCSI
  Potentially remote disks that are accessible over a 
  network using the iSCSI protocol. For more
  information, see below.

At least one category must be selected.  By default, only 
'Local Disks' are selected.

When you have completed your selections, press Next to continue.

NOTE: There may be a delay as the selections entered are
validated.



iSCSI

Important: To install to an iSCSI disk you must ensure 
that the disk in question can act as a boot disk and that your 
system has the necessary support for iSCSI booting.

If you select the 'iSCSI' category, you may need to provide
additional information as follows.

If your system supports autodiscovery of iSCSI disks, the
'Use DHCP autodiscovery' option is enabled.  Clicking
this button populates the criteria fields with the values
returned from the autodiscovery.  To further
refine these values, click the 'Specify search criteria'
button and edit the values.

NOTE: It is a function of the system's DHCP client to support
this feature. If your system does not support this feature, the 
'Use DHCP autodiscovery' option is disabled.

If you click the 'Specify search criteria' button, you can manually
enter values for the following fields:

Note: For further information about the iSCSI terminology, 
see the iscsiadm(1M) man page.

	- Target IP
	  The IP address of the iSCSI target.  Four numbers in
	  the range 0-255 must be entered.  The system at this
	  IP address must be online and accessible from this
	  system.
	  These fields are mandatory.
	- LUN
	  The Logical Unit Number of the iSCSI device located
	  at the IP address above.  The LUN is often a hexadecimal
	  value such as "0", "1", or "a".
	  This field is optional.
	- Target Name
	  The name of the iSCSI target in iSCSI Qualified Name
	  (IQN) format.
	  This field is optional.
	- Port
	  The port number used in conjunction with the above
	  IP address for discovering the iSCSI device.
	  The default value of "3260" is the port typically used
	  for iSCSI.
	  This field is optional.
	- Initiator Name
	  The initiator node name to be set for the iSCSI
	  discovery session.
	  For iSCSI booting, this field is disabled as the
	  initiator node name cannot be modified.
	  This field is optional.
	- Use CHAP
	  Click this button if you wish to enter CHAP
	  (Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol)
	  authentication details.
	- Name
	  The CHAP name to be used for authentication.
	  This field is optional.
	- Password
	  The CHAP secret value for authentication.  If entered,
	  this value must be between 12 and 16 characters long.
	  This field is optional.

If you choose the 'iSCSI' option, there may be a delay when you select
'Next' while the details entered are validated. 
If the iSCSI Target and/or LUN cannot be discovered, an error is displayed. 
You cannot proceed until the problem is resolved, either by
entering valid criteria or by de-selecting 'iSCSI'.
