DOS PARTITIONS

This screen displays the existing DOS partitions for the storage device that you selected in the previous screen.  The partitions are listed in layout order.


PROCEDURE

To exit this help screen, press F3.  Then, in the installer screen, use the arrow keys to highlight either "Use the whole disk" or "Use a partition on the disk."

    * If you select "Use the whole disk," the installer records that choice and proceeds to the next task.

    * If you select "Use a partition on the disk," the next screen enables you to select which existing DOS partition to use for the installation and to make changes to the partition layout.

	CAUTION: If you select "Use the whole disk", the entire disk will be erased during the installation and overwritten with the new Oracle Solaris OS in GPT format.

Press F2 to continue to the next screen.

NAVIGATION

Use the function keys listed at the bottom of each screen to navigate between screens. Use the arrow keys to move through the text on each screen. If your keyboard does not have function keys, or the keys do not respond, press ESC to view the alternate ESC keys for navigation.
